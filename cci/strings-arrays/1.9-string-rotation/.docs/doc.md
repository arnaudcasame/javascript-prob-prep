## 1.9 - String Rotation:
Assume you have a method isSubstringwhich checks if one word is a substring of another. Given two strings, sl and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of sl using only one call to isSubstring 

#### Example:
```js
input: `(erbottlewat, waterbottle)`
output:
explanation: `"waterbottle"` is a rotation of `"erbottlewat"`.
```
