/**
 * CCI - 1.2
 * PROBLEM:
 * Check Permutation: Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.
 * HINTS: #1, #84, #122, #131
 * 1) Describe what it means for two strings to be permutations of each other.
 * Now, look at that definition you provided. Can you check the strings against that definition?
 * 2) There is one solution that is 0(N log N) time. Another solution uses some space, but is O(N) time.
 * 3) Could a hash table be useful?
 * 4) Two strings that are permutations should have the same characters, but in different orders. Can you make the orders the same?
